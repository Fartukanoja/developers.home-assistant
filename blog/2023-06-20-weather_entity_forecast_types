title: "Weather entity forecast types"
---

`WeatherEntity` now supports different forecast types in the same entity instead of creating different entities for, as example, a daily forecast and an hourly forecast.

Integrations should be updated to not use the deprecated `forecast` property and instead use the new ones of `forecast_daily`, `forecast_hourly` and `forecast_twice_daily`.

Also the "Weather Forecast Card" has been updated to provide the user with an option to select the preferred forecast to show, if the integration are using the new properties.
